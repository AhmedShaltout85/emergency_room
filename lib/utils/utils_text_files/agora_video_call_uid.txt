To use a specific uid in the Agora video call code, you need to pass it when joining the channel using the joinChannel() method. In the code provided, the uid is currently set to 0, which allows Agora to assign a unique ID automatically.

To use a specific uid, follow these steps:

1. Define the UID
Declare the UID as a constant or pass it as a parameter to the widget:

dart
Copy
Edit
// Define a specific UID
const int myUid = 12345;
2. Pass the UID to joinChannel()
Replace the uid parameter in joinChannel() with your specific UID:

dart
Copy
Edit
await _engine.joinChannel(
  token: token,
  channelId: channel,
  uid: myUid,  // Use your specific UID here
  options: const ChannelMediaOptions(),
);
3. Update the Local Video View
Ensure the local video view uses the same UID:

dart
Copy
Edit
child: _localUserJoined
    ? AgoraVideoView(
        controller: VideoViewController(
          rtcEngine: _engine,
          canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: myUid),  // Use the same UID here
        ),
      )
    : const CircularProgressIndicator(),
4. Update the Remote Video View
No changes are needed for the remote video view because it listens for the onUserJoined event and uses the remoteUid value automatically.

Example Changes
Here is a modified snippet of the relevant sections:

dart
Copy
Edit
const int myUid = 12345;

await _engine.joinChannel(
  token: token,
  channelId: channel,
  uid: myUid,  // Use specific UID
  options: const ChannelMediaOptions(),
);
dart
Copy
Edit
child: _localUserJoined
    ? AgoraVideoView(
        controller: VideoViewController(
          rtcEngine: _engine,
          canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: myUid),  // Match the specific UID
        ),
      )
    : const CircularProgressIndicator(),
Note:
Ensure the uid is unique in the channel; otherwise, there will be conflicts.
If you are using tokens for authentication, make sure the token is generated with the same uid.
This change ensures you are using a predefined uid instead of letting Agora auto-assign one.

how local user and remote user can join the same channel with uid
ChatGPT said:
To have both the local and remote users join the same Agora channel with specific UIDs, follow these steps:

Use Unique UIDs: Make sure each user has a unique uid. For example, the local user can have uid = 12345, and the remote user can have uid = 67890.
Join the Same Channel: Both users must join the same channelId.
Generate Tokens (if required): If you're using token authentication, generate tokens for each UID using your backend server.
Step 1: Define UIDs and Channel
First, define the UIDs and the channel name. Make sure the channel name is identical on both devices:

dart
Copy
Edit
const String channel = "testChannel";
const int localUid = 12345;
const int remoteUid = 67890;
Step 2: Join Channel with Specific UID
In the joinChannel() method, use the localUid for the local user:

dart
Copy
Edit
await _engine.joinChannel(
  token: token,
  channelId: channel,
  uid: localUid, // Use the specific UID for local user
  options: const ChannelMediaOptions(),
);
On the remote device, you should use remoteUid instead:

dart
Copy
Edit
await _engine.joinChannel(
  token: token,
  channelId: channel,
  uid: remoteUid, // Use the specific UID for remote user
  options: const ChannelMediaOptions(),
);
Step 3: Display Local and Remote Video
In _localUserJoined, display the local video using the localUid:

dart
Copy
Edit
child: _localUserJoined
    ? AgoraVideoView(
        controller: VideoViewController(
          rtcEngine: _engine,
          canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: localUid), // Use local UID
        ),
      )
    : const CircularProgressIndicator(),
In _remoteVideo(), display the remote video using the remoteUid:

dart
Copy
Edit
Widget _remoteVideo() {
  if (_remoteUid != null) {
    return AgoraVideoView(
      controller: VideoViewController.remote(
        rtcEngine: _engine,
        canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: _remoteUid),
        connection: const RtcConnection(channelId: channel),
      ),
    );
  } else {
    return const Text(
      'Please wait for remote user to join',
      textAlign: TextAlign.center,
    );
  }
}
Step 4: Handle Remote User Joined Event
Listen for the remote user joining the channel and update the state accordingly:

dart
Copy
Edit
_engine.registerEventHandler(
  RtcEngineEventHandler(
    onUserJoined: (RtcConnection connection, int remoteUid, int elapsed) {
      log("Remote user $remoteUid joined");
      setState(() {
        _remoteUid = remoteUid;
      });
    },
    onUserOffline: (RtcConnection connection, int remoteUid, UserOfflineReasonType reason) {
      log("Remote user $remoteUid left channel");
      setState(() {
        _remoteUid = null;
      });
    },
  ),
);
Step 5: Generate Tokens (Optional)
If you are using tokens for security, generate tokens with the corresponding UIDs on your backend. Ensure that each UID has its own token.

Example token generation logic:

Local user (localUid = 12345) → Token generated for UID 12345
Remote user (remoteUid = 67890) → Token generated for UID 67890
Step 6: Run on Two Devices
Device 1 (Local User): Run the app with uid = 12345
Device 2 (Remote User): Run the app with uid = 67890
Ensure both devices:

Use the same channelId (testChannel)
Have internet connectivity
Are granted microphone and camera permissions
Summary
Use unique UIDs for each device (12345 and 67890 in this example).
Both devices join the same channelId.
Use tokens generated for specific UIDs if using token authentication.
The local video uses the localUid, while the remote video listens for the remoteUid.
This approach ensures the local and remote users join the same channel using predefined UIDs, enabling stable video communication
