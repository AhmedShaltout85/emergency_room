how to call two Future methods in initState method flutter app

In a Flutter app, you can call two Future methods inside the initState method using either the Future.wait approach to run them in parallel or by calling them sequentially using await (if needed).

Method 1: Running two Future methods in parallel using Future.wait
If the two Future methods can run independently of each other, you can run them in parallel using Future.wait. Here's an example:

dart
Copy code
class MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Call two Future methods in parallel
    _callFutures();
  }

  Future<void> _callFutures() async {
    await Future.wait([
      _firstFutureMethod(),
      _secondFutureMethod(),
    ]);
  }

  Future<void> _firstFutureMethod() async {
    // Simulate some work
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    print("First Future completed");
  }

  Future<void> _secondFutureMethod() async {
    // Simulate some work
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
    print("Second Future completed");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Future Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Futures are running'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
In this example, both _firstFutureMethod and _secondFutureMethod will run concurrently, and the app will wait for both to complete before proceeding.

Method 2: Calling two Future methods sequentially
If the two Future methods need to run sequentially (i.e., one after the other), you can call them using await for each method:

dart
Copy code
class MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Call two Future methods sequentially
    _callFutures();
  }

  Future<void> _callFutures() async {
    await _firstFutureMethod();
    await _secondFutureMethod();
  }

  Future<void> _firstFutureMethod() async {
    // Simulate some work
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    print("First Future completed");
  }

  Future<void> _secondFutureMethod() async {
    // Simulate some work
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
    print("Second Future completed");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Future Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Futures are running'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
In this case, _firstFutureMethod will finish before _secondFutureMethod is started.

Points to consider:
Use Future.wait when you want to execute the futures in parallel.
Use sequential await calls if one Future depends on the completion of the other.
Ensure that initState does not contain async directly, as it can cause issues. Instead, use an auxiliary method like _callFutures().
