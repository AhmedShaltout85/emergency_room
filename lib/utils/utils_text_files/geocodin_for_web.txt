The geocoding package relies on native device services (Android/iOS) to fetch coordinates from an address and does not work on the web. For web compatibility, you can use the Google Maps Geocoding API, which works across all platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop.

Here’s how you can implement geocoding (address to coordinates) for the web using the Google Maps Geocoding API in Flutter:

1. Obtain a Google Maps API Key
You need a Google Maps API key to use the Geocoding API.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a project or use an existing one.
Enable the Geocoding API.
Create an API key.
2. Add the http Package to Your Project
In your pubspec.yaml file, add the http package to make HTTP requests:

yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.5  # Or the latest version
Then, run:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
3. Create a Function to Call Google Maps Geocoding API
Here’s how you can make an HTTP request to the Google Geocoding API and get latitude and longitude from an address.

dart
Copy code
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class AddressToCoordinates extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AddressToCoordinatesState createState() => _AddressToCoordinatesState();
}

class _AddressToCoordinatesState extends State<AddressToCoordinates> {
  String address = "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA";
  String coordinates = "";
  String apiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'; // Replace with your actual Google API key

  // Function to get latitude and longitude from an address using Google Geocoding API
  Future<void> _getCoordinatesFromAddress(String address) async {
    final url = Uri.parse(
        'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${Uri.encodeComponent(address)}&key=$apiKey');

    try {
      final response = await http.get(url);
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final data = json.decode(response.body);

        if (data['status'] == 'OK') {
          var location = data['results'][0]['geometry']['location'];
          setState(() {
            coordinates = "Latitude: ${location['lat']}, Longitude: ${location['lng']}";
          });
        } else {
          setState(() {
            coordinates = "Error: ${data['status']}";
          });
        }
      } else {
        setState(() {
          coordinates = "Error: Failed to fetch data";
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        coordinates = "Error: Unable to get coordinates";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getCoordinatesFromAddress(address);  // Convert on startup
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Address to Coordinates"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              "Address: $address",
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              coordinates,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: AddressToCoordinates()));
}
4. Explanation
Google Maps Geocoding API: The API returns the latitude and longitude when provided with a valid address.
HTTP request: The http package is used to send a request to the Google Geocoding API.
Handling JSON response: The response from the API is parsed using json.decode() to extract latitude and longitude.
5. Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
Don’t forget to replace the YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY in the code with the actual API key you obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

6. Run the App
Now, when you run the app, it will fetch the coordinates using the Google Maps Geocoding API, and it should work on both web and mobile.

This approach will allow you to convert addresses to coordinates in Flutter for both web and mobile platforms.

it return error:REQUEST_DENIED

The REQUEST_DENIED error typically occurs when there’s an issue with your Google API key or permissions. Here are the possible reasons and steps to resolve the issue:

1. API Key Issues
Invalid API Key: Make sure you are using the correct API key. You can double-check this in the Google Cloud Console.
Billing: Ensure that billing is enabled for your project. Google Cloud requires billing to be set up for using most APIs, including the Geocoding API.
You can set up billing in the Google Cloud Console if it's not already enabled.

2. Enable the Correct API
You need to enable the Geocoding API specifically, as it is separate from other Google Maps APIs like Maps JavaScript or Places API.

To enable:

Go to the API Library in the Google Cloud Console.
Search for "Geocoding API" and enable it.
3. Restrictions on the API Key
If your API key is restricted, it might block access to the Geocoding API. You can adjust the API key restrictions:

Go to the API Key Settings:

Open the Credentials page in the Google Cloud Console.
Select your API key from the list.
Check for Restrictions:

If you have applied restrictions (e.g., IP restrictions, app restrictions), make sure they are configured properly.
For testing, you can temporarily remove restrictions or set them as needed for your use case.
4. Ensure Geocoding API is Enabled in the API Key Settings
After selecting your API key:

Under API restrictions, make sure the Geocoding API is enabled. You can also set it to "None" to allow all APIs for testing.
5. Check Quotas and Usage Limits
Verify if you've hit any quota limits for your API usage:

Go to the Quotas page in the Google Cloud Console.
Check your Geocoding API usage and ensure you're not exceeding any limits.
6. Testing without Restrictions
To isolate the issue:

Remove all restrictions from the API key (temporarily).
Test the code again to see if it works.
If it works, apply restrictions gradually (like limiting it to the Geocoding API or specific domains) to figure out what was causing the problem.
7. Correct URL Format
Ensure the request URL is correctly formatted and uses the correct key. The key should look like this:

dart
Copy code
final url = Uri.parse(
    'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${Uri.encodeComponent(address)}&key=$apiKey');
Make sure address is properly encoded using Uri.encodeComponent to handle spaces and special characters.

Example Workflow to Check:
Ensure billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
Make sure the Geocoding API is enabled.
Test your API key without any restrictions.
Properly format your request URL, making sure the API key is appended correctly.
If you follow these steps and the issue persists, it’s likely related to how the API key is set up in Google Cloud Console.
